# Cimrec : Recommendation Framework

> Cimrec Türkçe 'simrek' telafuz edilir.

Cimrec is a framework of recommendation system algorithms. This framework help you to make recommendation in any programming language using the respected API for the target langauge. 

## Why use cimrec? 

Cimrec gets your data as input, and based on your choice of algorithm and accuracy metrics, a high quality recommendation is provided.

Cimrec also provides caching like mechanisms in order to use as minimum resources as possible.

## Current Progress

Currently, the framework is at its inital phase. This project has been started as a research on a new user-based similarity method (Timebin Based Neighbourhood) as the result of our [Temporal Drift research](https://github.com/katipogluMustafa/TemporalDrift).
Temporal Drift research was a way for us to get to know the recommendation system algoritms and create our target framework cimrec. As the temporal drift project advaced, we also tried to create a basic framework as the skeleton of cimrec. All states of this skeleton framework has been traced as [Project Alpha](https://github.com/katipogluMustafa/project-alpha/).
